# Academix â€“ Your Smartest Study Companion! ðŸš€ðŸ“š

**Academix** is a powerful study assistant tool built with Python, Streamlit, and AI-powered models like Google's Gemini and sentence-transformers. This tool allows you to upload study materials, summarize documents, create quizzes, generate notes, and query documents using natural language processing (NLP). It also provides intelligent question-answering capabilities based on the content of your documents and external web searches.

## Features

- **File Upload**: Upload PDFs and text files for processing.
- **Document Summarization**: Automatically generate concise summaries of documents.
- **Quiz Generation**: Create quizzes based on the content of uploaded documents.
- **Document Q&A**: Ask questions related to the uploaded documents and get answers using a mix of document content and web search results.
- **Notes Generation**: Generate key insights and notes from documents.
- **Search Integration**: Fetch relevant information from the web when the context from the document is insufficient.
